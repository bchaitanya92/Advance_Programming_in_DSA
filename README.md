## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
- C compiler (e.g., GCC, MinGW, or any standard C compiler)

### 2. Compile & Run
Open your terminal, navigate into the desired folder, and run the compilation command.

**Example for a file in Level 1:**
```powershell
# Navigate into the correct directory
cd Level_1_Basic_Sorting_and_Simple_Problems

# Compile and run the C file
gcc Quick_Sort_Time_Complexity.c -o quick_sort.exe
./quick_sort.exe
```
Replace Quick_Sort_Time_Complexity.c with any file you want to run from that directory.

## 💡 Usage

- Browse the `.c` files to study or modify the code
- Compile and run programs to see how each advanced data structure or algorithm works
- Use as a reference for assignments, interviews, or self-study
